**Title:** Jabra - Get the Basics Right
**Role:** Lead Programmer, UX/UI Designer

## Summary
In collaboration with Jabra, we crafted an immersive VR training program aimed at enhancing product installation proficiency. Designed to expedite the onboarding process, this program equips new Jabra employees with the skills to efficiently install and utilize their products, significantly reducing the initial learning curve. Catering to diverse learning needs, the training program offers tiered instruction, empowering employees with the choice between basic and advanced product installation setups. The training program, powered by a Quest 2 headset, controllers, and microphones, delivers a realistic simulation for a hands-on, authentic experience.
