In the formative stages of any immersive VR training program, it is fundamental to identify the key experiences to be delivered. With Jabra, a global authority in the audio equipment landscape, we intended to equip new employees with the skills to install Jabra products efficiently. The goal was to replicate real-world conditions in a virtual environment, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.

# Contribution and outcome
I tend to be heavily involved in most parts of the productions in which I take part. I am very multidisciplinary, and understanding each aspect of a production allows me to maintain good communication between members of the team. Here is a brief rundown of my contributions to this project:
- Lead programmer in charge of the architecture and delegation of tasks, code review.
- Implementation of a custom node-based narrative system capable of generating dialogue audio and manuscripts (.docx) directly inside Unity.
- Implementation of a custom audio manager system that integrates with the node-based editor.
- Designing the user experience.
- Optimization of assets to make proper use of UV space and reduce light artifacts during baking.
- Shader programming for UI (procedural shapes).
- Custom system for plugging in cables in a generic way by defining connector types and input types.

Through trial and error, we crafted an effective training program that resonated with Jabra. The VR training platform empowers users to install and use Jabra products proficiently. The project's success was reflected in the words of Claus Holmbeck Madsen, Global Head of Knowledge & Learning at GN Audio:

*“It will also be part of our onboarding process. Letting everyone have physical access to all our products would be a logistical challenge, but here we can skip a few steps and make sure everyone becomes familiar with the most important products. Initially the experience has six products, but we can easily update the application remotely and add new products and features to headsets at all locations. It will be a part of our onboarding process and accelerate the time it takes for new employees to get familiar with Jabra.”*

# Reflections and lessons
While the project was a success, it was also an opportunity for me to reflect on my decision-making and development approach. Early in the project, I aimed to create a decoupled system using a scriptable object event architecture, inspired by a talk at Unite Austin 2017 by Ryan Hipple. I went with a framework called Unity Atoms, which is an open-source library that aims to make your game code:

- Modular (avoid scripts and systems directly dependent on each other)
- Editable (Scriptable Objects makes it possible to make changes to your game at runtime)
- Debuggable (modular code is easier to debug than tightly coupled code)

As a result, we created a simulator that could emulate different Jabra devices primarily by communicating using Unity Atoms. For example, when the user plugs in a cable, our system communicates data from one end of the cable to the other based on a fully simulated data transfer protocol. The cool thing is that you can track the data in real-time, and even create fake data for testing purposes without ever compiling.

However, it turned out that the heavy reliance on scriptable objects throughout the project complicated things. While they offered modularity, their excessive use led to challenging debugging scenarios. Code cohesion was practically lost, and maintaining the system became painstakingly difficult and time-consuming. This experience taught me to use such tools judiciously and only when absolutely necessary. Today, I would have written the system entirely in code, to avoid many of the pitfalls. A more sensible approach would be not to assume that we need designer-friendly tooling from the get-go, which is one of the things that drew us to an event-based architecture with scriptable objects as the foundation.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, working on this project was an enriching experience that reinforced my abilities as a programmer and designer. The lessons learned and the challenges encountered during the process have undoubtedly shaped my perspective on future projects. Even though some decisions made in the early stages of the project led to challenges in the end, it was these very hurdles that provided the most valuable learning opportunities.
