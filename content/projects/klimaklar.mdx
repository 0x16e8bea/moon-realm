In collaboration with Odense and Esbjerg Kommune, we at Virsabi developed the 'Klimaklar' app. The app leverages augmented reality to achieve two critical goals: visualizing the potential effects of climate change in urban areas and catalyzing community resilience against these changes. Users can employ the app to simulate water levels during heavy rainfall, effectively assessing flood risks based on accurate statistical data relative to their GPS coordinates. Furthermore, the app allows users to explore the advantages of rain gardens in AR, to teach how effective water management can prevent flooding. These engaging and informative functionalities are further enhanced with an X-ray vision feature, allowing users to peer beneath the surface and understand the underlying mechanisms of these potential solutions.

# Contribution and outcome

Upon joining Virsabi, Klimaklar was my inaugural project. With the project at its midpoint and a three-member developer team already in place, I made the following contributions:

- Leveraging shader programming to develop water simulations for the 3D map (using signed distance fields) and creating an underground X-ray vision feature (making extensive use of stencils).
- Implementing a map pin and a mathematical formula to translate between GPS coordinates and an arbitrary 3D coordinate system using three points for calibration (primarily using linear algebra)
- Undertaking a complete UI redesign and implementation (completed in two weeks).
- Developing app logo branding.
- Implementing custom multi-touch interactions framework, providing intuitive navigation and object translation within the app.

The project was received with immense positivity. Originally intended for Odense municipality, I believed the app could further benefit from a design overhaul. With the team's initial design done by programmers due to a lack of dedicated designers, I took the initiative to reimagine the app's design at no additional cost. After securing approval from my supervisor, I was able to completely redesign and implement the new look within a two-week span. 

The revamped design not only garnered praise from the clients but also added substantial value to the product. The refined aesthetics and improved functionality significantly contributed to our ability to extend the product's reach. Subsequently, we successfully pitched and sold the enhanced product to Esbjerg municipality, further validating the app's effectiveness and appeal. The Esbjerg version carried the same core experience, with the addition of a few new features, broadening our impact and footprint in the climate resilience space. I was also elected to product owner during this time.
